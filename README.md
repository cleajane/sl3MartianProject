# Title: Implementation of 32-QAM Tx-Rx System using MATLAB 
Presentation: https://youtu.be/C-GlQv8GuXA 

Description: In this project, an audio file would be transmitted through a QAM scheme and the receiver would receive the signal and demodulate it. White/Gaussian Noise would also be added to make the TX-RX system closer to real-life systems. The receiver would recover the audio file input with plausible data. 

Rationale: The proponents aim to create the Tx - Rx QAM system to understand more about Digital Communications. As described, the system is not noiseless and the challenge is recovering the signal with plausible audio. To make things different from the internet, the students would not use Simulink or any built-in application from MATLAB.  

Features of the QAM Transmission and Receiver System:
Generates a modulated signal using QAM
Generates a carrier signal of a particular frequency
Generates a test signal of known frequency, amplitude, and phase
Uses Different Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) to test the Tx-Rx Model
Displays the transmitted and received signals on display
Presents the Bit Error Rate for Accuracy
